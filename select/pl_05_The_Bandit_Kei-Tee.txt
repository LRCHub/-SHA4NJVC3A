Chiseled their names in stone
Heavy the load you tow
And the red horse is
always close
And the fire don't burn below
Two hundred miles to clear
Chasing a sound I hear
When the call brings them all
to tears
And the hopes
they all turn to fears
And they're walking around
With their heads
in the cloud screaming
Must catch the bandit
Reckless abandon
Rundown and stranded
Must catch the bandit
Tracks in the dirt for days
Sniff out the fire ablaze
And the red door,
it seems to sway
And it carries a heavy weight
And they're walking around
With their heads
in the cloud screaming
Must catch the bandit
Reckless abandon
Rundown and stranded
Must catch the bandit
And they're walking around
With their heads
in the cloud screaming
Must catch the bandit
Reckless abandon
Rundown and stranded
Must catch the bandit
