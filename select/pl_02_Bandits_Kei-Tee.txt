Pop bottles I’m da celebration
We gone keep
the speakers vibrating
Cause you here
I’m here
Now what you make it
Im through the 4
Get love out in vegas
Turned it up loud
And packed a few bongs
Might break a few hearts
Don’t answer my phone
Selfish
I can’t help it
Lemon Water
Still the muhfuckin beverage
And I cool it down
Was here before
Ask and plot
And then say thats what I’m on
Cruise control no
thats what I'm on
Do as as we want
U keep the suggestions
Low as a plane
Know they second guessed it
I just believe you gone shine
if you destined
Mister DARR
Now they question my presence
Get ya phone on the way
to the exit
This the part
where u gone put yo hands up
Turn up like where is yo manners
On ten
Say i never panic
Groupie hoes and party bandits
This the part
where u gone put yo hands up
Turn up like where is yo manners
On ten

Groupie hoes and party bandits

Get away now
(Get away now)
Told her we gone get away now
One thing that u knew
Soon as i walked in
We gone see it plays out
Say We all turnt up
Momma told me be safe
Beach balls by Supreme
With the Fiji
By the case load
Negative
Vibe killing
Niggas
Yea we hate those
Double C M
Wolves
Yeah u never can replace those
So many times
I don't react
We lit
We jumping off our calfs
The youngest in
Triumphant
Skin
Raise the bar
You raise the hands
Pause
Hell nah party all around
With this anthem
Wisco to Kansas
Young rockstars
Them young Party Bandits
Granted
If This my blank canvas
Then Ima make sure it
They feel it
all around the planet
